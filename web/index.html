          No matter what field of science you pursue, if your field even remotely connects to chemistry, chances are you have come across this field called ‘Chemical Kinetics’.
          From optimising reactions into producing desired yields, to insights into mechanistic pathways of reactions, kinetics provides us with all.
          In this little project, we will try to provide a physical insight into kinetics, limiting our explicit use of maths.
          We will deal with a specific branch of kinetics that deals with a very important class of reactions - enzyme catalysed reactions.
          If you are familiar with enzyme catalysis, we’re sure you would have come across (even be a devotee of XD) the Michaelis-Menten equation.
          <br><br><br>
          What most people are, however, not aware of is the limitations of this model - the overwhelming simplifications and assumptions we make in the process of coming to this reaction.
          The mathematics of these intricate assumptions and their improvements might be too much to look at for non-specialists (including most of us who use these models).
          However, we believe a more physical representation is possible, and would serve our understanding very well.
          We will also have a look at some inhibition kinetics in a similar light, and enjoy the details.
          The mathematics hasn’t been omitted, and those who want to enjoy a more mathematical description can always tune into the “mathematical details (input clever name?)” sections included besides every visual representation.
          No more boring details here, let's jump right into some basic kinetics! (feel free to skip around to other sections if you want :D)
