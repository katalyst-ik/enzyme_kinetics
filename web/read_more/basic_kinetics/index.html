          No matter what field of science you pursue, if your field even remotely connects to chemistry, chances are you have come across this field called ‘Chemical Kinetics’.
          From optimising reactions into producing desired yields, to insights into mechanistic pathways of reactions, kinetics provides us with all.
          In this little project, we will try to provide a physical insight into kinetics, limiting our explicit use of maths.
          We will deal with a specific branch of kinetics that deals with a very important class of reactions - enzyme catalysed reactions.
          If you are familiar with enzyme catalysis, we’re sure you would have come across (even be a devotee of xD) the Michaelis-Menten equation.
