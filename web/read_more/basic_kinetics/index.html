          We all have seen those fancy arrows that we use to represent chemical reactions. But if you think about it, a chemical reaction, in essence, is just molecules colliding in the reaction medium and trying to attain more and more stable states as they do so. Everything else in chemistry is just trying to rationalize this fundamental physical law for molecules. In this module, we would go through a special class of molecules - Enzymes, through a kinetics-based study.
          <br/><br/>
          Before we go there, though, let us begin with some fundamental kinetics, shall we? You went through it in high school, we know! But what is the harm in taking another look? That way, you could get accustomed to our way of delivering things as well! 
          <br/><br/>
          Firstly, think of what comes to your mind when you see the word “rate”? A quick Wikipedia search yields the following result: “In mathematics, a rate is a ratio between two related quantities in different units.” Indeed in chemistry, the rate of a reaction is a measure of the progress of a reaction with respect to time. More specifically, it is the speed at which the reactant is consumed (or the product is formed.) 
          <br/><br/>
          Let’s look at a dummy reaction with reactant R and product P to get a feel for this-

          <br/><br/>
            
          R⟶ P
          <br/><br/>
          Here, we could describe the rate in two ways:  -d[R]/dt or d[P]/dt. Here, [R] (or [P]) describes the concentration of the reactant species R (or product P). Remember that the reaction rate is the speed at which the reactant disappears - Hence the negative sign.
          <br/><br/>
          Of course, you’d seldom find a reaction that has just one reactant and yields only one product in the lab. This module will eventually take you to enzyme kinetics (more on that later), and you need at least two “reactants” for such a reaction - a ‘substrate’ and an ‘enzyme’. That means at least two things on the left side of the arrow, which means more complexity, but also more fun!
          <br/><br/>
          Let us think about this issue for a while: How can we describe the rate of the reaction given below?
          <br/><br/>
            aA + bB -> cC + dD
            <br/><br/>
          What this equation means is just that ‘a’ number of molecules of reactant A would react with exactly ‘b’ molecules of B and give ‘c’ and ‘d’ molecules of C and D, respectively. This means that the reactants will be consumed (and products produced) in proportions of their “stoichiometries”. We can extend the idea of rate described earlier to any reaction if we normalise for the stoichiometries.
          <br/><br/>
          [Insert the rate equation with stoichiometries divided] 
          <br/><br/>
          Enough about rates. Let us look at some other ubiquitous, albeit often confusing, terms - Order and Molecularity of a reaction. 
          <br/><br/>
          The order of a reaction is just the number of concentration terms we need to multiply to obtain a rate equation - the relation between the rate of a reaction and the concentration of the species taking part in it. So for a first-order reaction, the rate of the reaction would be proportional to one concentration term. For a second-order reaction, two and so on. You’d get a much better feel for this as we look into each of these orders individually. 
          <br/><br/>
          The molecularity of a reaction, on the other hand, defines the number of molecules altered in the reaction. If a reaction just changes A to B, it is unimolecular. If two molecules collide for the reaction to happen, it is bimolecular and so on [Animation here if possible]. It is difficult to imagine more than three molecules colliding at the same time in a reaction. Trimolecular (or termolecular) reactions are rare; anything above three is near impossible. 
          <br/><br/>
          People usually make an error to think that the order and molecularity of a reaction are the same. After all, it seems only logical to imagine that if two molecules need to collide for a reaction, for example, the concentrations of both of those species should affect the rate. Honestly, this logic isn’t flawed. The issue? Most reactions just aren’t that simple. They involve multiple steps, with distinct molecules colliding in each step. 
          <br/><br/>
          If we were to check the order of these elementary steps, we would indeed find the order and molecularity to be the same. However, when one looks at the reaction overall, the order would be an amalgamation of these steps without the intermediates. There is no meaningful order for most complex reactions as the rate isn’t a simple product of concentration terms anymore! In these scenarios, we will have to fall back on the idea of breaking the reaction down into multiple steps and working the rate out for them. One rarely finds a proper order for even the most uncomplicated enzymatic reactions.
          <br/><br/>
          We will now look at some graphs and play with them to familiarise ourselves with this concept of orders and molecularities. Real-life examples of such reactions and experimentally produced plots for those examples have also been provided. After all, you want to get a feeling for what happens in the lab and not just what the equations tell you.

          We first look at a zero-order reaction; the rate does not depend on the concentration of the reactant(s). The rate, therefore, is constant during the reaction and sees no change as the reactant is consumed. This constant rate is the rate constant of the reaction.
          <br/><br/>
          Graphically, we expect to see a straight line parallel to the time axis in the concentration profile of the reaction. Photochemical reactions, such as the reaction between H2 and Cl2 to produce HCl is one such zero-order reaction, given below.
          <br/><br/>
          As you might expect, zero-order reactions appear in particular circumstances, where what triggers the reaction is constant in time. In most cases, the reactant concentration itself is an important triggering factor, as the collision of these reactants is required for the reaction to proceed.

          Let us now move on to the first-order reaction. We’ll use the decomposition of H2O2 to understand it better. The proportionality constant is our rate constant since the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of our reactant. It is evident if you alter the value of ‘k’ using the slider below.

          At this stage, we can introduce the concept of the half-life of a reaction. It is the time required for the concentration of the reactant to reduce to half of it’s original value. Head over to the mathematics section to see that this is the half-life of a first-order reaction. How much time will it take for a first-order irreversible reaction to reach 100% completion?
